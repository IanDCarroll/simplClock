# simplClock
    is a basic command line counter and python module.

I was enjoying the idea of using an infinite loop as a feature rather than a bug to be avoided.
Also the sheer simplicity of the code.

the inspiration for this was a bit of code <a href="https://github.com/tmuthamizhan">__@tmuthamizhan__</a> threw together at a Python for Testers class at a conference in Disneyland. Full credit for the idea! :smile:
